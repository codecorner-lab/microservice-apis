## 1. Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

This Python API is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+.

## 2. Folder Structure <a name="folder-structure"></a>

The folder structure for the project is as follows:

```
.
├── Pipfile
├── Pipfile.lock
└── orders
    ├── api
    │   └── api.py
    └── app.py
```

## 3. Environment Setup <a name="environment-setup"></a>

Before getting started, ensure that you have Python 3.6+ installed on your system. Additionally, it's recommended to use `pipenv` for managing dependencies.

## 4. Dependency Installation <a name="dependency-installation"></a>

To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the root directory of your project.
2. Run the following command to install the dependencies specified in the Pipfile:
   ```
   pipenv install
   ```

## 5. Testing the API <a name="testing-the-api"></a>

To test the API locally, follow these steps:

1. Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```
   uvicorn orders.app:app --reload
   ```
   This will start the API server on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

2. Use tools like cURL, Postman, or your browser to send requests to the API endpoints as described in the [API documentation](#).

## 6. Pushing to Remote Repository <a name="pushing-to-remote-repository"></a>

To push your local repository to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub), follow these steps:

1. Initialize a local Git repository using `git init`.
2. Add your files, commit changes, and link your local repository to a remote repository using `git remote add origin <remote_repository_URL>`.
3. Push your changes to the remote repository using `git push -u origin main`.
